### Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## Domain Modeling
 
 - Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

 ## HTML Table Basics

 - Why tables are not to used for  Layouts: 
    - Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users
    - Tables produce tag soup
    - Tables are not automatically responsive
    
- 3 different semantic HTML elements:
    - <th> element ('th' stands for 'table header')
    - <td> element ('td' stands for 'table data')
    - <tr> element ('tr' stands for 'table row')

## Introducing Constructors
    - Advantages of using Constructors 
      - create more than one object from a single object definition, and that's the subject of the next section.
    - bind 'this'to the new object, so you can refer to this in your constructor code

## Object Prototype 
    - Object prototypes can help make simplfy functions and make the easier to share methods.

  ## Things I want to know more about

  I learned more about tables but I also wanted to know how to make it work with CSS.
