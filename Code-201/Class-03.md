## HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

## HTML: HyperText Markup Language
  - Unordered lists are used to display a bullet, which can be of several forms, like a dot, a circle, or a square. 

  - The bullet style of a undordered list can be changed by a associated CSS, using the list-style-type property.

  - An ordered list is used for a numbered list.  An unorder typically rendered as a bulleted list.

  - Two ways to change number list:

    - the list-style property, to choose the way the ordinal displays

    - the line-height property

 - Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box.

 - Four part of HTML elements:
    - Content box: The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height
    
    - Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties.
    
    - Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.
    
    - Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties.

## Learn JS: JavaScript â€” Dynamic client-side scripting

Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.

- Conditional should used is Javascript to helpo get certain information in increments. 

- Loops are all about doing the same thing over and over again. It would help reset form with condition.

- No people array is not a valid Javascript array.

- In an array we can store various data types strings, numbers, objects, and even other arrays. 

- Five Shorthand Operators:
  - Addition assignment 	x += f() 	x = x + f()
  - Subtraction assignment 	x -= f() 	x = x - f()
  - Multiplication assignment 	x *= f() 	x = x * f()
  - Division assignment 	x /= f() 	x = x / f()
  - Remainder assignment 	x %= f() 	x = x % f()
