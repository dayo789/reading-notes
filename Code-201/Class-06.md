### Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM


## JavaScript object basics

- I would decribe a object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. 
- Adavantages odf creating litterals:
    - Encapsulate related code. Encapsulation (or grouping) of related code helps prevent clashes between variable or function names.

    - Minimize the use of global variables.
    - Eliminate anonymous functions.
    - Easy to debug.
    - Increase reusability and portability.

- bracket notation can be more useful when a person wants to set values dynamically or a custom value types.

- It is the way of introduction, which is basially stating "Spot" and  "2"

### Introduction To The DOM

-  (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.

- Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
